# Data Structure Final

This is a graded assigment given to me as a CCNE student in the Lebanese University.

This will be used to determine my mark for the Data Structures Lab course.

The assigment is found on the github repository as a docx file.

The requirements:

1. Allow user to add Teachers.
2. Remove Teachers.
3. Edit Teachers.
4. Display Teachers.

What I did:

1. Created a Teacher struct to store the Teacher's details.
2. I created a List struct representing a LinkedList to store a school's Teachers.
3. <a href="https://doxygen.nl/" target="_blank">Doxygen</a> to create docs.
